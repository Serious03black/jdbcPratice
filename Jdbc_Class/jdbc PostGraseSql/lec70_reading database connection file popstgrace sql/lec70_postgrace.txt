industry reccomend to never hard code the value like url and connection line that chagne in future

the solution for the above peroblem is use properties(.prop or .txt)
eg application to configure the jdbc releted dbreleted inforrmation i properties file using in java jdbc app

eg
                                        |
                                        |------------propex
                                                        |
                                                        |----dbprops.txt
                                                        |----selectTest.java

#jdbc driver & database reletd table details
mydriver=org.postgresql.Driver
url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
user=root
pwd=tiger
qry=select*form student;
closte the connection


Avoid Hardcoding Values: Instead of hardcoding database connection details, store them in a properties file (e.g., db.properties).
Load Properties File: Use FileInputStream to load the properties file in your Java application.
Create and Load Properties Object: Use java.util.Properties to load and access the data from the properties file.
Retrieve Property Values: Retrieve the JDBC configuration values (driver, URL, username, password, and query) using the getProperty method from the Properties object.
Establish JDBC Connection: Use the retrieved values to establish a connection to the database using DriverManager.
Perform Database Operations: Create a Statement object to execute SQL queries and process the results.
Handle Resources Properly: Ensure proper closing of database resources (e.g., ResultSet, Statement, Connection) after operations are completed.
