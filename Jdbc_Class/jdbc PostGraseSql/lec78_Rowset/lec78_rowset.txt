Limitation with Result set object:
========================================================
1.It is not in serilized form
2.it not support bean style prograemming.
3.To overocem above limitation /problem use "rowset",given from JDBC 

object become serilizable object only when its clss that implement java.io.serilizable INTERFACE. WE CAN SEND ONLY SERILIZABLE OBJECT OVER THE NETWORK 


#rowset:
====================
rowset object means its the object of a JDBC driver supplied java classs tha implemets javax.sql,rowsest interface. this rowset is the sub-interfaccce of java.sql.resultset interface.

we have 3 types of rowsets:
1)cached RowSet:
            Its a discounted Rowset.
            Behaviour-wise,its like in-senesitive Reultset object.
2)jdbc Rowset:
    its connected Rowset.
    behaviour-wise,its like sensetive Resuktset object
3)webset:
    its connected rowset.
    Collected the data from xml files.

All Rowset object are serilizalbe object & they supports bean style programming.
